### Digital Product School:

The last three months I participated as AI Engineer at the DPS a project by the UnternehmerTUM. In a successful collaboration with the Landeshauptstadt MÃ¼nchen, our international and crossfunctional team embarked on a mission to inspire the younger generation to appreciate and embrace the rich history and culture of Munich. Understanding the stories and traditions that have shaped our world is crucial, and history serves as a fascinating subject for exploration.

### SuccessStory:

The user problem we sought to address was the lack of engaging formats to present history, hindering users from immersing themselves in historical contexts. Our solution enables users to:

- Embark on an individual journey through the rich and meaningful history of Munich.
- Enhance their knowledge through various engaging methods, enabling them to better grasp the city's development and culture.
- Utilize gamification to playfully impart knowledge, making the app accessible to all.

### Applications of AI:

We leveraged generative AI to create historical content, providing users with immersive experiences. Additionally, we transformed content into an Audioguide format to appeal to all human senses. Personalized recommendations based on users' preferences and behavior further enriched the experience.

### Tools Used:
